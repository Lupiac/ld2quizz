# LOD2QUIZZ

## Requirements
You need NPM and NodeJS to develop and run the project

## Structure
In the *_/src_* folder, we have 3 subfolders:
- *_assets_*: used to keep our images
- *_components_*: where we have the different custom component used by each page
- *_views_*: where our views are

## Deployment
The files in the _*/dist*_ folder are supposed be served by an HTTP server
You can deploy the built content in the dist directory to any static file server

Run: _npm run build_ to create and fill the folder with the built content
